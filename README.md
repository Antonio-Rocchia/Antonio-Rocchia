# I am Antonio Rocchia ‚úç

I enjoy walking without a specific destination to clear my mind and think.
Programming, running, playing chess, and writing are activities that bring me joy.

I'm about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (a mix of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) from Unibo in Italy. I code for fun in my spare time and once I earn my degree, I will continue my studies. I'm eager to cultivate my passions, not just in coding, and share more of my work online. I'd like to start a blog and a YouTube channel, but only time will tell where my journey will lead.

## My repositories
I publish my personal projects on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Antonio-Rocchia/).
